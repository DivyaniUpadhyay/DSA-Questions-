Question 1

//You are a teacher arranging a trip for  students. You have a class of N students  and you want to divide them into two groups for the trip However, you have planed one group should only consist of students with even numbered ID's and the other group should only consist of students with odd-numbered IDs an both the groups must be of the same length. Your task is to find and return an integer  value representing the maximum number of students that can be included in both groups
//Input Specification:
//input : An integer value N representing the total number of students
//input2: An integer array containing the IDs of the students.
//Output Specification:
//Return an integer value representing the maximum number of students that can be included in both groups.
//Example 1:
//input1:4
//input2: (5,2.3.6)
//Outout: 2
//Assessment 2021-2031
// Program :

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of students: ";
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> ids(n);
    int evenCount = 0, oddCount = 0;

    cout << "Enter the student IDs: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> ids[i];
        if (ids[i] % 2 == 0) {
            evenCount++; 
        } else {
            oddCount++; 
        }
    }

    
    int maxGroups = min(evenCount, oddCount);
    cout << "Maximum number of students in both groups: " << maxGroups << endl;

    return 0;
}

// output: 

Enter the number of students: 4
Enter the student IDs: 5 2 3  6
Maximum number of students in both groups: 2
